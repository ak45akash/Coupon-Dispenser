MILESTONE 2 – AUTHENTICATION & ADMIN DASHBOARD BASE

Original Description:
Develop secure authentication (NextAuth + Supabase) and create the base admin panel layout.

Original Deliverables:
• Admin login with NextAuth (Super Admin and Partner Admin roles).
• Role-based access and protected routes.
• Dashboard layout (sidebar, topbar).
• Vendor Management (Add/Edit/Delete vendors).

Implemented Features & Enhancements:

A. Secure Authentication (NextAuth + Supabase)
   A robust authentication system has been implemented using NextAuth in conjunction with Supabase, providing secure user access.

B. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   • Admin Login
     Super Admin and Partner Admin roles are fully functional, with distinct login capabilities.
   
   • Protected Routes
     The application features role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access routes and functionalities relevant to their assigned roles.

C. Comprehensive Dashboard Layout
   • Sidebar & Topbar
     A clean and intuitive dashboard layout has been developed, including a responsive sidebar for navigation and a functional topbar.
   
   • UI Enhancements (shadcn/ui)
     The entire user interface has been significantly upgraded using shadcn/ui components, providing a modern, aesthetic, and animated user experience. This includes:
     - Improved buttons, cards, tables, dialogs, inputs, labels, badges, pagination, and dropdown menus.
     - Custom animations for a more dynamic feel.

D. User Management
   • Super Admin User Creation
     Super Admins can now directly create new users from within the application via a dedicated modal.
   
   • Automated Welcome Emails
     Newly created users receive a customized welcome email with a secure link to set/reset their password, eliminating manual password entry during creation.

E. Vendor Management
   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for vendors is implemented, allowing Super Admins and Partner Admins to manage vendor data efficiently.

F. Pagination System
   • Users, Coupons, and Vendors Pages
     All major data tables (Users, Coupons, Vendors) now feature a comprehensive pagination system.
   
   • Customizable Options
     Users can select between 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page.
   
   • Persistence
     Page size preferences are saved locally for each page type, ensuring a consistent user experience across sessions.
   
   • Intuitive Controls
     Includes "Previous" and "Next" buttons, direct page number selection, and a page size dropdown.

G. Coupon Statistics
   The Coupons page now prominently displays total, available, and claimed coupon counts at the top, providing quick insights.

KEY FEATURE HIGHLIGHT: SOFT DELETE & TRASH FUNCTIONALITY

A critical enhancement implemented across the system is the Soft Delete and Trash functionality for Users, Coupons, and Vendors.

• Soft Deletion
  Instead of permanent deletion, items are now "soft-deleted," meaning they are marked as deleted in the database but not immediately removed. This prevents accidental data loss.

• Trash Section
  A dedicated "Trash" section has been added to the Super Admin dashboard (accessible via the sidebar).

• Restore Capability
  Super Admins have the ability to view all soft-deleted items and restore them if needed.

• Permanent Deletion
  Items in the trash are automatically permanently deleted after 30 days. Super Admins can also manually trigger permanent deletion for individual items from the trash.

• Audit Trail
  The system tracks who deleted an item, enhancing accountability.
