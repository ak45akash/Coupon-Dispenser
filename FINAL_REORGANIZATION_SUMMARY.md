# Final Reorganization Summary

## Current Status
✅ Tab structure exists with 3 tabs
✅ Tab 1 (WordPress Plugin) - Complete
✅ Tab 2 (API Key) - Has management card, needs code examples
❌ Tab 3 (JWT) - Missing, old code is misplaced outside tabs

## Implementation Required

I need to reorganize approximately 400 lines of code to:
1. Complete Tab 2 with API Key code examples
2. Create Tab 3 with Partner Secret + JWT code examples
3. Remove old misplaced section

**This is a significant reorganization. Proceeding now...**
