# Reorganization Status

## ✅ What's Done
1. Tabs structure created (3 tabs: WordPress, API Key, JWT)
2. Tab 1 (WordPress Plugin) - Complete placeholder
3. Tab 2 (API Key) - Has API Key Management card
4. Helper functions created:
   - `getApiKeyPythonCode()`
   - `getApiKeyNodeCode()`
   - `getPythonCode()` (for JWT)

## 🔄 What's In Progress
Reorganizing the tabs to properly structure all three methods. The file is large (1480 lines), so I'm implementing this carefully.

## ⏳ What Remains
1. Complete Tab 2: Add API Key code examples
2. Create Tab 3: Partner Secret Management + JWT Code Examples  
3. Remove old misplaced code section

**Proceeding with implementation now...**
